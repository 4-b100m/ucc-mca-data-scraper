### Git Workflow

**Merging Branches:**

*   To merge all branches into your current branch:
    1.  List all branches using `git branch --all`.
    2.  For each branch to merge (excluding the current branch), run `git merge <branch-name>`.
    3.  Resolve any merge conflicts.
    4.  Push changes using `git push origin <current-branch>`.
*   To merge your current branch into the `main` branch:
    1.  Switch to the `main` branch: `git checkout main`.
    2.  Merge your current branch into `main`: `git merge <current-branch>`.
    3.  Resolve any merge conflicts.
    4.  Push the updated `main` branch: `git push origin main`.

**Resolving Merge Conflicts:**

1.  Check for files with conflicts using `git status`.
2.  Open each conflicted file and locate conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> branch-name`).
3.  Edit the files, keeping the desired content and removing the conflict markers.
4.  Stage the resolved files: `git add <file-name>`.
5.  Commit the resolution: `git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"`.

## DEBUGGING

**"Element with id Copilot on My Behalf... is already registered" Notification:**

*   This notification from VS Code indicates the GitHub Pull Request extension (or related) has already registered a UI element.
*   This is generally safe to ignore.
*   If repeated issues or UI glitches occur, restart VS Code or update extensions.
