## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Starts the Vite dev server
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Creates a production build
- **Preview**: `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

### Code Style

- This project uses ESLint for code quality and consistency
- Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
- The project uses TypeScript - ensure all type definitions are properly maintained
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines

### Project Structure

Please maintain the existing project structure:

```
./src
  /components     # React components
    /ui          # Reusable UI components (Radix-based)
  /lib           # Utilities and types
